# Crowdfunding-ETL
## Overview
### Purpose :
In this Analysis, we will assist Britta to perform both an ETL process on this dataset and a data analysis by using SQL queries.
     - In this Challenge, we will be using Python, Pandas, and Jupyter notebooks to do the extract and transform phases. 
     - Specifically, we will extract and transform the backers’ contact information from a CSV file to create a DataFrame that will be exported as a CSV file and              do the load phase. 
     - Specifically, we will use the dataset to create an ERD and a table schema for creating a new table in the crowdfunding_db database.
     - And, we will upload the CSV file that contains the backers’ information into this table. 
     - Finally, will perform a data analysis on the crowdfunding_db database by using SQL queries.
